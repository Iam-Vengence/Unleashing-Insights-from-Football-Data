Unleashing insights by preprocessing data ,visualizing data ,dashboard and predicting using machine learing
Football is a global, popular, and dynamic sport with many different factors that can influence the outcome of a match. By analyzing large datasets of football data, teams can gain a deeper understanding of factors that contribute to players' success, enabling coaches, scouts, and analysts to make informed decisions.
Football data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights. The valuable insights extracted from this analysis can be used to improve player performance, team tactics, fan engagement, and overall decision-making. 
Various data analysis techniques, such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation, prediction using ML models using tools like Python, MySQL, Excel, and Tableau, can be employed to extract meaningful insights. These insights aim to enhance decision-making, improve team performance, and provide a competitive edge in the sport.


This involves data preprocessing, conducting exploratory data analysis, performing descriptive analysis with various data analysis and visualization techniques, predictions using statistical models, and machine learning models. Multiple tools such as Python, MySQL, Tableau, Excel must be used based on requirements of the analyses. The objective of this sprint is to merge multiple data files and preprocess the football dataset for further analysis.
